Language, literature, artistic, creative art, architecture, manual work, cinematographic and broadcasting are all part of European cultural diversity.
The European Union has two objectives: to maintain and to support its diversity and to make it available to others.
EU cultural industries – cinematographic and audiovisual industries, publishing, music industry and handwork – are all important sources of revenue and job providers, giving about seven million people activities.
The Union has economic responsibility for this area and seeks to ensure the right conditions for European industry to be competitive at international level.
Therefore, the EU has launched programmes to support certain cultural industries, which encourage them to exploit the opportunities offered by the single market and digital technologies.
The EU will also seek to create a dynamic environment for these industries by facilitating access to finance, contributing to research projects and encouraging cooperation with the Union's internal and external partners.
The Union also includes a cultural dimension in many other policies such as education (including language learning), research, support for new technologies and information society and social and regional development.
For example, the European Social Fund is supported by the Italian Arturo Toscanini Fund, which has organised courses to the unemployed musicians since the mid-1990s.
The specific objectives of the current cultural programme are to promote awareness of cultural objects at European level and to promote their preservation; promote transnational mobility of cultural workers; encourage the transnational distribution of works and cultural and artistic works; encouraging intercultural dialogue.
"Media" programmes aimed at making the European audiovisual sector more dynamic and competitive have worked since the mid-1990s.
Each year, the two cities will be chosen as a European Capital of Culture and will provide them with the right to receive financial support.
Linguistic diversity is the cornerstone of the culture and democracy of the European Union.
The language is not only open to other cultures, but also gives us the opportunity to get to other countries by travelling or working on part of cultural contacts.
An estimated 40 million people in the EU speak English, which is not their country of origin.
The aim of the CAP is to ensure a reasonable standard of living for farmers, to provide consumers with high-quality food for a fair price and to preserve our land.
There have been more than 20 years since the first wave of reforms.
Our main source of information and entertainment is television.
Each of us, on average, three hours a day's news, sports transfers, movies and other shows.
The government of each Member State has its own audiovisual policy, while the Union establishes rules and guidelines for common interests, such as the EU and open borders and fair competition.
In order to protect its cultural diversity and promote local products, the EU has called for a "cultural "derogation" to be achieved in the World Trade Organisation".
Due to the speed of technological innovation, broadcasting and telecommunications have approached each other.
Open borders and affordable transport have given Europeans an unrepresented personal freedom of movement.
Goods are rapidly transported and effectively from the factory to consumers who are often able to take place in different countries.
The European Union has contributed, opening up the internal market to competition and removing physical and technical barriers from free movement.
However, current transport models and growth rate are not sustainable.
The rapid, efficient and cheap transport capacity of people and goods is a guiding factor for the EU's dynamic economy and a coherent society.
The removal of cross-border trade and travel barriers has increased the volume of freight and passenger transport.
Although many aspects of transport policy fall within the scope of the Member States, it is reasonable that the common European market is a single transport infrastructure.
Over the past ten years, the EU has opened national transport markets for competition across the Union, in particular in road and air transport and less rail transport sectors.
As a result, transport cars can be taken after goods in other and domestic countries, so they do not turn back into international wars as a void.
By road transport, 44% of all goods in the EU are now transported by 39% of short sea roads, 10% of railways and 34% of inland waterways.
The transition from freight and passenger transport to road transport to less polluting modes is a key factor in any sustainable transport policy.
The European Union (EU) is a family of democratic European countries that is committed to cooperation on peace and prosperity.
The EU is not a country which should replace existing countries, nor should the international cooperation organisation.
Europpa's historical beginnings go back to the Second World War.
The idea was born because Europeans decided to prevent the repetition of such killing and destruction.
Six countries were cooperating in the early years, mainly in the area of trade and the economy.
Now, 27 countries and 490 million people belong to the EU, and it deals with a number of different issues that are directly important for our everyday lives.
Europe is a continent of many traditions and languages, but it also has common values, such as democracy, freedom and social justice.
In the 21st century world, in which countries are increasingly dependent on each other, more needs to be done by every citizen of Europe in a spirit of cooperation with other countries in the spirit of curiosity, openness and solidarity.
You can travel most of the EU without passive and without stopping you to border control.
The 10 EU's story as a step from the Schuman Declaration and six Member States to the EU in the 1950s until the enlargement of 2007 and to 27 Member States.
On 9 May 1950, the Schuman Declaration proposed the establishment of a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which would lead to the Paris Agreement of 18 April 1957.
The customs duties between six countries were fully cancelled on 1 July 1968 and common policies were set up in the 1960s, in particular trade and agricultural policy.

You can cross borders in the EU without controls and make the euro more favourable.
The Green Card is not compulsory when travelling in the EU, but it is an internationally recognised insurance certificate and facilitates compliance with the claims arising from accidents.
The creation of a single European market for air transport has meant lower fares and wider choice for airlines and services for passengers.
Within the EU, 210 000 km of railways are offered a range of international passenger services.
In several countries there are high-speed trains that reach up to 300 km/h and this year will extend the network to new connections in Belgium, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Latvia on the Baltic Sea side is low in land with large forests from which wood will be deployed for the construction and paperwork industry.
Consumer and textile goods and workshops are also produced in Latvia.
The ethnic population consists of 59% of the threshold and 29% of the Russians and more than a third of the population lives in the capital in Rio.
In the last year, Riia is the largest city of the Baltic States, the inhabitants are 730 000.

An international experimental fusion reactor, an important test facility aimed at proving that fusion energy production is scientifically and technically feasible.
Science and innovation will help create jobs, improve prosperity and quality of life.
After the success of the recent years, fusion energy research and development have reached a point where effective progress can be expected towards fusion sustainable energy production.
"Science is a key factor in competitiveness" said Janez Potočnik, European Commissioner for Research.
If our companies are to play a leading role in the future, they must invest in knowledge now and governments must take appropriate measures to help them.
The EU is part of a globalised world where knowledge is more evenly distributed than ever.
The thermofusion offers an opportunity to produce almost a limited amount of pure energy over a long period of time.
The low level of private R&D spending in Europe compared to the US is mainly due to industrial differences and that the European high-tech industry is lower.
As far as the level of science is concerned, although the EU is the largest creator of scientific knowledge in the world, the impact of European science is less than the US's science.
Europe is behind the impact of cites in terms of indicators and green practices in all scientific disciplines in the USA.
EU universities are also very under-represented on the top of the tensions based on the world's largest universities bibliometric indicators.
In addition, communications between technology (patented inventions) and the scientific base in the EU are much weaker than in the USA.
Europe is difficult to achieve a breakthrough in the new high-tech industry.
Today, a new discovery started to finance R&D, when the European Commission adopted proposals to launch a first European research and development partnership for all times.
To ensure our competitiveness and prosperity, Europe needs a new approach to knowledge in certain promising areas.
This is an area where funding at European level, at European level and industry provides much less added value, creating favourable conditions for funding for research and development by the private sector.
Invisible computers (embedded systems) today run all machines from cars, planes and phones, from energy networks and installations to laundry machines and television.
It is expected that more than 16 billion embedded systems are available by 2010 and more than 40 billion devices exist worldwide by 2020.
By 2010, these invisible chips account of 30-40% of the value of new products in the value of the consumer's electronics (41%), telecommunications (37%), auto- (36%) and medical devices (33%).
The initiative of innovative medicines supports the development of new knowledge, equipment and methods to enable faster take-up of better and safer medicines.
At present, the European Commission will present its ideas on the European Research Area, which form part of most of the potential of European knowledge.
The Commission's aim is to mobilise this potential by enabling people, infrastructure, organisations, funding sources, knowledge exchanges and global cooperation to function effectively.
The more effective creation and use of knowledge is very important if the EU wants to achieve its economic, social and societal objectives, which are listed in the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs.
Our future depends on whether Europe can become a truly knowledge-based society.
The European Research Area is the basis for which this knowledge-based society must be built.
Business companies are difficult to create partnerships with universities, in particular universities in other countries.
Researchers are still struggling to develop a career or to work elsewhere in the EU's research.
Public and regional funding for research is largely uncoordinated and thus ineffective.
The use of research results could be significantly improved.
There are guidelines attached to the document which help research institutions to improve links to industry, highlighting the good practice in the management and exchange of knowledge and intellectual property.
Sufficient competent researchers, who are very mobile bodies, research areas, sectors and countries, are one of the main tents.
The aim of the Directive is to achieve a good level of quality of all rivers, lake, estuous waters, coastal waters and groundwater by 2015 in the European Union.
Sustainable water management is vital to safeguard the competitiveness of biodiversity, citizens' well-being and European industries.
The participating partners benefit from greater visibility, higher capacity of research and development, better financial incentives and the reduction of risk related costs.
Businesses will be directly involved in research and education, contributing to entrepreneurship support among graduates and researchers.
The European Commission has now taken the view of the best updating of European universities.
Universities in Europe have a huge potential, a large proportion of which is, unfortunately, untapped as a result of rigid and different obstacles.
The release of large knowledge, talent and energy supplies requires an intermediate, comprehensive and coordinated change: From the method of regulation and management of systems to university governance methods.
Although universities are training and teaching millions of people every year, there are still a number of obstacles in European higher education systems, many of which are old decades.
Universities are the drivers of the creation of knowledge.
Universities need to adapt to the requirements of the global, knowledge-based economy, as they must adapt to society and other sectors of the economy.
Each institution should find a balance between education, science and innovation, which is best suited to its role in the region or in the country.
The aim is to create a framework in which university schools can become stronger players in a global knowledge-based society and in the economy.
The Commission is ready to support the modernisation of EU universities through a good practice identifying and sharing process and through its education, research and innovation funding programmes.
The European Commission has identified 9 areas where changes should be made so that European universities can contribute to the creation of a genuine knowledge-based economy.
One of the proposals is to allow students to use national loans and subsidies everywhere in the EU where they choose to learn or study.
We must change national education and support schemes so that best students can participate in higher education and continue their research careers regardless of their background.
We need to make universities' funding systems more focused on the fire and allow universities more responsibility for their long-term financial sustainability, especially in research activities.
We must allow universities to become more autonomy and accountability so that they can react quickly.
This could include a review of curricula to adapt to new developments, the establishment of closer relations between research sites and focus on research areas rather than specific disciplines (e.g. renewable energy, nanotechnology).
It may also include greater autonomy at the level of the individual institution at the selection of educational and scientific staff.
In all EU Member States, seat belt belts must now be confirmed in all vehicles, including tourist buses and microbuses.
To ensure that in Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom you drive on the left side of the road and remember that in some countries, such as Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Portugal, you must normally provide a better approach to vehicles.
The use of the mobile phone at the time of driving the vehicle significantly increases the risk of hazardous accidents in life and is either directly or indirectly prohibited in all EU Member States.
Although in most EU Member States a maximum alcoholic strength of 0,5 mg/ml is authorised in most EU Member States, it amounts to 0,2 mg/ml up to 0,8 mg/ml (0,9 mg/ml in Cyprus) and in some countries no alcohol may be in the blood during driving.
When travelling in the EU, the passenger insurance policy automatically provides a minimum law for the protection of insurance required (traffic insurance).
The speed limit is generally 110, 120 or 130 km/h on motorways and is 50 or sometimes 60 km/h.
As a flight passenger, you have certain rights in the case of flight and booking information, baggage damage, delays and withdrawal, non-admission, accident or travel problems.
These rights apply both to domestic and international routes and airlines from one of the EU airports or from outside the EU airport to an EU air carrier.

Where necessary, Member States may take the necessary urgent measures in view of the overall objectives of the Joint Action.
The Union's policy in this Article does not affect the specific nature of the security and defence policy of certain Member States and shall take into account the obligations of the Member States following the North Atlantic Treaty, which will see their joint protection in the North Atlantic Agreement (NATO); the Union's policy is consistent with the common security and defence policy established under that Treaty.
In international organisations and international conferences, which do not take part in all Member States, Member States shall rely on common positions.

The Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty) was signed in Rome on 25 March 1957 and entered into force on 1 January 1958.
The purpose of the Euratom Agreement was to coordinate research programmes for peaceful use of nuclear energy already started or planned in the Member States.
This agreement is now transposed into the EC Treaty in a way.

The Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC Treaty) is the oldest of the three Treaty establishing the European Community and signed in Paris on 23 July 1952 and expired on 23 July 2002, since it was concluded for 50 years.
The purpose of the agreement was to establish a common coal and steel market and the same scheme was gradually extended to other economic sectors.
It is now applicable to the coal and steel sector to the normal arrangements of the EC Treaty.
Such agreements shall always be concluded between subjects of international law (Member States or organisations) with a view to starting international cooperation.
International agreements are another source of EU legislation that enables the European Union to develop economic, social and political relations with the rest of the world.
Agreements concluded under the first pillar of the European Union are binding on the Union and the Member States; agreements concluded within the Union under the second and third pillar are binding to the institutions, but not always to the Member States.
The Association Agreements include close economic cooperation together with a broad financial contribution from the Community to the contractual partners.
Cooperation agreements are not as comprehensive as association agreements, because only close economic cooperation is concerned.
Trade agreements have been concluded with the Association Group of nonUnion countries or non-EU countries, or in the framework of international trade organisations, with regard to customs and trade policy agreements.
Agreements between Member States are binding legislation to address issues which are closely linked to Community action, but which do not have the powers conferred on the Community institutions, or to extend the boundaries of national provisions to establish a common Community legislation (such as the Community Patent Agreement).
Secondary legislation is the third largest source of Community legislation after the Treaties (primary legislation) and international agreements.
Secondary legislation covers binding legislation (regulations, directives and decisions) provided for by the EC Treaty and non-binding acts (resolutions, opinions), together with all other acts such as internal rules and Community action programmes.
The legislation relating to the second and third pillars, which does not actually fall within the scope of secondary legislation, as they continue to be governed by intergovernmental relations, is covered by a proper documentation in this category.
The Regulation adopted jointly by the Council and the European Parliament or only adopted by the Commission is the main measure of which all parts are binding.
In contrast to the directives aimed at Member States, and decisions aimed at specific beneficiaries, regulations are aimed at all.
The regulation is directly applicable, which means that it will be created in all Member States without delay by the law that will enter into force, such as the national legislation, without any need to be done by the national authorities.
The consolidation of the basic act (Treaty or any Community act) and subsequent amendments and corrections to be included in one of the texts which are not formally authentic.
