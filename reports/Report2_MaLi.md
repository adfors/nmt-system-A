##### Conclusion
Most of the translation errors are incorrect words regarding the sense. Many words are wrongly translated into words that do not make any sense in the current context. In some cases estoninan expressions are translated word by word into an english expression which does not make sense as well. In addition lots of the translated words do not appear in the correct form, for instance plural instead of singular or wrong verb tenses. Furthermore content words are missing in many sentences. On the one hand there are whole expressions missing and on the other hand just single words which are important for the sense of the sentences. On the contrary extra words appear, just like a sentence contains one word twice instead of once. Just a few mistakes occur regarding unknown words, missing filler words or word order. 


### Analyse of attention weights

There is incorrect BPE splitting ("antikaaonid was split to an@@ tika@@ a@@ onid").

![Visualisation of translation](/reports/alignments_1508780925474.png?raw=true "Wrong BPE splitting")
Due to incorrect BPE splitting we see 'sheep' instead of 'lights'.


###### Conclusion
1. Some sentences from dev set were taken from physics and the current translation system did not train on physics sentences, so we get some inappropriate translations, like "black mass" instead of "dark matter"
2. Compound words often are translated incorrectly.
3. There are a lot of translations with incorrect grammar tense.
4. Abbreviations are translated sometimes incorrectly.
5. Coverage Deviation Penalty (CDP) correlates with BLEU score better than other metrics (something wrong with Absentmindedness Penalties for output, it equales 100% for all sentences).
5. There are mistakes in human translations (see Sentence 40: in original sentence only month is mentioned whereas in human translation data is used).
